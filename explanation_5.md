# Blockchain

## About data structure
- LinkedList
  - I chose LinkedList because I wanted to use data connections.

## About Order complexity
Computational complexity of O (n) is required to acquire and add blocks.

## About implementation
When adding a new block, it loops to the end and sets the hash value of the last block to the latest block.

Also, the seed value is set to fix the output.
