# Active Directory

## About data structure
- hashmap
  - I created a hashmap with the user name as the key.
## About Order complexity
$O(1)$
## About implementation

I use hashmap to check if a user belongs to a group.
You can check if the specified key exists by creating a dictionary from the array.

The amount of calculation required to acquire data by this conversion is $O(1)$.

It's efficient.
